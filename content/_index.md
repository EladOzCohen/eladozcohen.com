description: Hey there, I'm Elad! I'm currently a data analyst at Matrix Ltd where I use my wizardry in Pyhton and BI tools to sprinkle some analytical magic and optimize organizational behavior. In my free time, you'll catch me fueling my coding spells with coffee (totally not an addict), hitting CrossFit, hanging with my crew, and acquiring new analytical skills. Here, I'll share fun and useful nuggets on data analytics, coding, and science. Let's dive into the data together!
