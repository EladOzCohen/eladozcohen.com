description: Hello there! I'm Elad. I'm currently a data analyst at MatrixDnA where I use my wizardry skills in Python and various BI tools to help organizations make better decisions and grow. I currently live in Rishon-Lezion, Israel. In my free time I enjoy coding, coffee (I'm not an addict, I don't want to stop), CrossFit, reading, and spending time with friends and family. In this blog, I will share my thoughts and joys about data analytics, data visualization, coding languages such as SQL, R, Python, and science in general.
