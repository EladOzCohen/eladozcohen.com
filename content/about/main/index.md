  As youâ€™ve noticed, Iâ€™m Elad Oz-Cohen, an aspiring data analyst. Iâ€™ve come across both the SQL and R programming languages and statistics during my Master's Degree in Cognitive Psychology, and I have been hooked ever since then. Although this (wonderful!) encounter was not expected, as the phrase goes: "life is like a box of chocolate..." During my Master's I've also grown fond of data visualizations. Although my academic research supplied me with plenty of opportunities to visualize data, I craved more opportunities, hence discovering the "TidyTuesday" challenge, which I'll share (some) of my results here. I love the R community, data visualization challenges, and more recently other languages such as SQL, and Python, and doing baby steps in JS. Thatâ€™s also what I blog about here. It could be curious questions I came across (such as probability, text-analysis) or challenges I faced somewhere, solved, and would like to share with my future self or you. Hope you enjoy your visit and again, reach out so I can get to know you better ðŸ˜„
