  Welcome to my website! I'm Elad, a highly skilled data analyst proficient in SQL, Tableau, Excel, R, and Python. In my academic years I've spearheaded dozens of experiments (some published in top journals) which provided me with extensive experience in analyzing, visualizing, and extracting valuable insights from big-data & developing a keen eye for detail and a passion for transforming data into actionable insights.

  I bring a strategic mindset to every project, using my expertise to identify patterns, trends, and valuable opportunities. Whether I'm building a dashboard in Tableau, conducting advanced statistical analysis in R, or crafting complex queries in SQL, I'm always pushing myself to deliver the highest-quality work possible.

  When I'm not immersed in data, I'm spending time with friends and family, talking long walks while listening to a good podcast, and breaking new personal records in CrossFit training. I believe that success requires balance, and I bring that same level of dedication and discipline to everything I do.

  Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. If you're looking for a data analysis professional who will deliver results, I'm your person. Let's connect and start making data-driven decisions that drive success! :)
